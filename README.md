# monster in the dark

A simple find the monster before your flashlight runs out of battery.

## what I learned

- how to move an element to a random location
- how to call a function every 5 seconds
- callback functions

## what to improve on

- Fix: mouse should not return to original position everytime the light shrinks
- Shorten js code and make it more readable
- A scoring system
- Make monster more interactive like shrinking when the light shines on it
